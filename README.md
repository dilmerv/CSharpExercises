# CSharpExercises
A repo to use as a playground for C# .NET Core Console Apps / .NET Core Web Apps


1. Create a new .NET Core Web API Service to handle retrieving information about players for your upcoming VR game.
2. Be sure to keep project namespace within the StampinUp.Service.*
3. DATA should all be retrieved in JSON format
4. Data we would be interested in getting:
   - An endpoint to retrieve all players
   - An endpoint to retrieve players by id/email
   - An endpoint to insert a new player into a memory collection
   - An endpoint to update an existing player's
5. All of the data can be kept in memory, but create a class to hold the player's information and inject it by using dependency injection.
6. Some of the users have a third party service, how can we get user data from https://gorest.co.in/ and integrated into our VR game player's data?
